# Java-Simple-Chatbot
A simple console chatbots with keyword matching in java

Tried coding a chatbot using Java. Why not?

I always thought chatbots were a fancy thing and could only be done in Python. But I never realized… until yesterday.

## How it works
Many simple console chatbots start with **keyword matching** —  
check for a word → print a pre-written response.  
Simple, but effective for a first prototype.

Of course, not all console bots are this simple.  
Modern bots can use **machine learning** and **NLP** to handle complex interactions.

## Why Java?
So I thought, why not try it in Java?  
And yes, it works! You can build these bots in almost any language:  
**C, Java, Python… you name it.**

## A bit of history
Some of the earliest AI programs in the **1950s**, like **ELIZA (1966)**, used this exact approach.  
They were simple, rule-based programs that started the chatbot journey.  
From **ELIZA to GPTs**, the evolution has been huge.

## My experience
This was a really fun experience, even though it had its drawbacks:

⚠️ Limited knowledge  
⚠️ No freestyle input  
⚠️ Coding in Java feels harder than Python  

Still, a fun little experiment. I’m glad I learned that chatbots are nothing to fear.
